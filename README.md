# Withered Soul (developed using Unity)

## Logline
  A lost boy battles through a perilous, ever-changing worlds, following his curiosity through obstacles that mirror life's struggles in pursuit of something greater.
  
## Overview
  A **2D Side-Scrolling Platformer** following a young boy's journey through life's harsh challenges. As he ventures beyond his perceived world, he must overcome obstacles that test his resolve and reveal deeper truths about existence. 
  <br><br>
  My goal is to turn **2D Platforming** into a tool that replicates real-life struggles, developing the player’s critical thinking for overcoming challenges and finding solutions to confront their personal fears. With each stage mimics the iconic spiritual realms known to mankind **(Living World, Limbo, Paradiso, etc.)**
