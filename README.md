# Withered-Soul

## Logline
  A lost boy battles through a perilous, ever-changing worlds, following his curiosity through obstacles that mirror life's struggles in pursuit of something greater.

## Overview
  Withered Soul is a 2D side-scrolling platformer following a young boy's journey through life's harsh challenges. As he ventures beyond his perceived world, he must overcome obstacles that test his resolve and reveal deeper truths about existence. 
  <br><br>
  The goal of this game is to turn 2D platforming into a tool that replicates real-life struggles, developing the playerâ€™s critical thinking for overcoming challenges and finding solutions to confront their personal fears. Each stage of the game mimics iconic spiritual realms known to mankind (Living World, Limbo, Paradiso, etc.). By conquering these virtual trials, players experience a transformative journey that redefines their limitations, encourages self-reflection, and turns in-game achievements into tangible self-empowerment.
